# Movies Shop Application

The Movies Shop Application is a simple Android app that allows users to browse and shop for movies.
This app includes features such as sorting movies by price or name, filtering movies based on price
range, and viewing movie details. The app follows the Clean Architecture and MVVM (
Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture and utilizes libraries such as Jetpack Compose for UI, Hilt for
dependency injection, Coroutines for asynchronous programming, Room for database, and Retrofit for
networking.

## Acknowledgements

This application was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model created by
OpenAI. About `80-90 percent` of the code in this project was generated with the help of ChatGPT
based on instructions provided by the developer. In most cases, ChatGPT was able to provide accurate
and functional code solutions. However, there were instances where ChatGPT's answers were incorrect
or non-working. The developer identified these issues and, with the help of ChatGPT, resolved most
of them. In a few cases, manual adjustments were required by the developer.

The objective of this project was to leverage any AI tool for code generation. The developer guided
ChatGPT by providing instructions on the desired application behavior and the structure of various
classes. ChatGPT significantly expedited the development process by generating the majority of the
code.
